# Vintage Story Modding Examples

Welcome to the Vintage Story Modding Examples Repo.

This contains a set of content mods, made in JSON, and code mods, made using C#.

Most of these examples have follow-along tutorials on the [Vintage Story Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/Main_Page).

## Mod Examples

Each mod example has its own readme file associated with it - This will give a link to its wiki tutorial if one exists.

Most mod examples also contain two zip files, a 'setup' and a 'complete'. The 'setup' zip file allows you to follow along with the appropriate tutorial. 

## Mod Examples
This repository contains multiple sample mods which are configured as a .NET 7 project (`code_mods`) that let's you start Vintage Story and test your mod directly from within Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and Rider.

The folder `json_mods` contains mods purely made in json. Simply drop the folder of the mod you wanna test into your `Mods` folder and start the game.

For more information on modding see our [Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/Main_Page) section `Modding the Game`.
