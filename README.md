# Vintage Story Modding

## Mod Examples
This repository contains multiple sample mods which are configured as a .NET 7 project (`code_mods`) that let's you start Vintage Story and test your mod directly from within Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and Rider. For instructions how to setup a dev environment follow the instructions below.

The folder `json_mods` contains mods purely made in json. Simply drop the folder of the mod you wanna test into your `Mods` folder and start the game.

To setup a modding environment see our [Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/Modding:Setting_up_your_Development_Environment).
