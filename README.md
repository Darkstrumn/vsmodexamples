# Vintage Story Modding

This is Nat's updated repository for the newer modding tutorials.
For full content mod examples, please view the 'releases' section.
For full code mod examples, please view the newer 'updated-code-mod-tutorials' section.

## Mod Examples
This repository contains multiple sample mods which are configured as a .NET 7 project (`code_mods`) that let's you start Vintage Story and test your mod directly from within Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and Rider.

The folder `json_mods` contains mods purely made in json. Simply drop the folder of the mod you wanna test into your `Mods` folder and start the game.

For more information on modding see our [Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/Main_Page) section `Modding the Game`.
